# Bayesian Inference in Change-point Detection for Financial Markets

The ability to detect change-points in the stock markets is of vital importance for
both the investors and researchers. It is an established fact that the fluctuation of
stock price in one country can have a serious impact on other markets across the
globe. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian fusion method using t-shrinkage
prior and Horseshoe shrinkage prior to detect the change-points in the main stock
market and the cryptocurrency market. Fast and efficient computational procedures
are presented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods exploring the full posterior
distributions of all the parameters of interest. The model is then implemented on
two sets of simulated data, the historical data of Dow Jones Industrial Average
(DJI) cumulative return, and Bitcoin-USD cumulative return. The results show that
our model works efficiently detecting the potential crash or thrive in certain stock
market or cryptocurrency market in advance and helps make investment decision
accordingly.
